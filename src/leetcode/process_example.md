Đã hiểu. Bạn muốn tôi trình bày lại bài mẫu đó, nhưng tuân thủ nghiêm ngặt theo **cấu trúc outline** bạn đã cung cấp, thay vì viết thành một đoạn hội thoại liền mạch.

Đây là một cách trình bày rất có hệ thống, giống như một checklist trong đầu bạn. Tôi sẽ tái cấu trúc câu trả lời mẫu cho bài "Climbing Stairs" theo đúng format này.

### **Solving "Climbing Stairs" - Following the Universal Protocol**

#### **Phase 1: Understand**

- **Goal:** By confirming the important information from the requirement for both input and output, I can make sure that I fully understand the problem.

- **Rephrase the Core Task:**
  - I will have an integer `n` representing the total number of steps.
  - My main objective is to calculate the total number of distinct ways to reach the top, given I can only climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
  - The function will return a single integer.

- **Analyze I/O & Constraints:**
  - **Input:** `n` (number, positive integer).
  - **Output:** `number` (total distinct ways).
  - **Constraints:** The problem states `n` can be up to 45. This suggests that an exponential time complexity solution like O(2^n) will be too slow, and I should aim for a linear time complexity, O(n).

- **Question the Edge Cases:**
  - What is the expected output for `n=1`? (The examples suggest it's 1).
  - What about `n=2`? (The examples suggest it's 2).
  - These will serve as my base cases.

#### **Phase 2: Approach & Strategy**

- **Goal:** Show that I have a process to resolve the problem, starting from a simple idea and moving to an optimal one.

- **Brute-Force Solution First:**
  - My initial thought is to use recursion. To find the number of ways to get to step `n`, I can sum the number of ways to get to step `n-1` (and take one 1-step) and the number of ways to get to step `n-2` (and take one 2-step).
  - This gives the recurrence relation: `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`.
  - This is a correct but inefficient solution. Its time complexity is O(2^n) due to repeated calculations of the same subproblems.

- **Optimal Solution (O(n)):**
  - **Difference & Improvement:** Instead of a top-down recursive approach, I will use a bottom-up **Dynamic Programming** approach. This avoids re-computation by calculating the number of ways for each step sequentially, starting from the base cases.
  - **How it works:**
    1.  I'll handle the base cases for `n=1` (1 way) and `n=2` (2 ways).
    2.  I will then iterate from `i = 3` up to `n`.
    3.  In each step `i`, I'll calculate the number of ways by summing the results for `i-1` and `i-2`, which I have already computed and stored in variables.
    4.  This reduces the time complexity from exponential O(2^n) to linear O(n). The space complexity will be O(1).

#### **Phase 3: Think Aloud (Implementation)**

- **Goal:** Walk through my coding process step-by-step, keeping the interviewer engaged.

- **Start: Declare variables**
  - "First, I'll handle the base cases for `n <= 2`."
  - "Next, I'll declare two variables, `oneStepBefore` and `twoStepsBefore`, to hold the results for `n-1` and `n-2`. I'll initialize them to `2` and `1` respectively, which are the results for step 2 and step 1."

- **Focus on the core block (the loop):**
  - "Now, I'll start a loop from `i = 3` to `n`."
  - "Inside the loop, I'll calculate `currentWays` by adding `oneStepBefore` and `twoStepsBefore`."
  - "Then, I'll update my pointers for the next iteration: `twoStepsBefore` will become the old `oneStepBefore`, and `oneStepBefore` will become the `currentWays` I just calculated."

- **Handle return:**
  - "After the loop finishes, the variable holding the result for the last calculated step will be the answer, so I'll return that."

#### **Phase 4: Verification & Conclusion**

- **Goal:** Verify the solution with a simple example and wrap up the discussion.

- **Simple Example (Dry Run):**
  - "Let's quickly test with `n = 4`.
  - `oneStepBefore` is 2, `twoStepsBefore` is 1.
  - `i = 3`: `currentWays` = 2 + 1 = 3. `oneStepBefore` becomes 3, `twoStepsBefore` becomes 2.
  - `i = 4`: `currentWays` = 3 + 2 = 5. `oneStepBefore` becomes 5, `twoStepsBefore` becomes 3.
  - The loop ends. We return 5. This matches the expected output."

- **Confirm the Final Complexity:**
  - "This solution has a time complexity of **O(n)** due to the single loop, and a space complexity of **O(1)** as it only uses a constant number of variables."

- **Open for Discussion:**
  - "Does this approach look good to you? Please let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions."
