# The Universal Protocol for Coding Interviews

## Step 1: Understand

**Goal**: By confirming the important information from the requirement for both input and output, we can make sure that we fully understand the problem.

1. **Rephrase the Core task:**

- I will have `[input type]` to do `[main objective]`
- The function will return `[output type]`

2. **Analyze I/O & Constraints**

- Write down the constraint `input size`, which suggests a solution with time complexity- then we can feedback based on it the `input size`

3. **Question the edge cases**

- Give some questions about potential edge cases (an empty array, null, negative, single-element input) => Return?

## Step 2: Approach & Strategy

**Goal:** Show that we have a process to resolve the problem

**Brute-force solution first**

- Give a solution with `O(n^2)` and tell them that it is not efficient enough.
- Give another solution with `O(n) O(log n)`
- what is the difference? How does it reduce the previous solution?

## Step 3: Think Aloud

**Goal**: Show their step by step what us do, let interviewers engaged in our thought process

- start: declare variables
- Focus on line by line on the core block (important)
- Handle return

## step 4: Verification & conclusion:

**Goal:** Give a simple example and conclusion.

- Simple examples
- Confirm the solutions for `O(n)`
- Open to discussion: Please let me know your thought
