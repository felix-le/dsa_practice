### **Solving "Climbing Stairs" - Following the Universal Protocol (with Detailed Code)**

```
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1 step + 1 step
2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45
```

#### **Step 1: Understand**

- **Goal:** By confirming the important information from the requirement for both input and output, I can make sure that I fully understand the problem.

- **Analyze I/O & Constraints:**
  - **Input:** `n` (number, positive integer).
  - **Output:** `number` (total distinct ways).
  - **Constraints:** The problem states `n` can be up to 45. This suggests that an exponential time complexity solution like O(2^n) will be too slow, and I should aim for a linear time complexity, O(n).

- **Question the Edge Cases:**
  - What is the expected output for `n=1`? (The examples suggest it's 1).
  - What about `n=2`? (The examples suggest it's 2).
  - These will serve as my base cases.

#### **Step 2: Approach & Strategy**

- **Goal:** Show that I have a process to resolve the problem, starting from a simple idea and moving to an optimal one.

- **Brute-Force Solution First (Recursive):**
  - My initial thought is to use recursion, which naturally models the problem. The number of ways to get to step `n` is the sum of the ways to get to step `n-1` and the ways to get to step `n-2`.
  - This gives the recurrence relation: `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`.
  - The base cases are `ways(1) = 1` and `ways(2) = 2`.
  - This is a correct but inefficient solution. Its time complexity is **O(2^n)** because it re-computes the same subproblems multiple times.

- **Optimal Solution (Dynamic Programming):**
  - **Difference & Improvement:** Instead of a top-down recursive approach, I will use a bottom-up **Dynamic Programming** approach. This avoids re-computation by calculating the number of ways for each step sequentially and storing only the results of the last two steps.
  - **How it works:**
    1.  I'll handle the base cases for `n=1` and `n=2`.
    2.  I will then iterate from `i = 3` up to `n`.
    3.  In each step `i`, I'll calculate the number of ways by summing the results for `i-1` and `i-2`.
    4.  This reduces the time complexity from exponential O(2^n) to linear **O(n)**, with a space complexity of **O(1)**.

#### **Step 3: Think Aloud (Implementation)**

- **Goal:** Walk through my coding process step-by-step, explaining both solutions.

"First, I'll write out the brute-force recursive solution we discussed. It's a direct translation of the recurrence relation."

**Solution 1: Brute-Force Recursion (O(2^n) Time, O(n) Space)**

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the number of ways to climb n stairs using a naive recursive approach.
 * NOTE: This solution is inefficient and will exceed the time limit for larger n.
 */
function climbStairs_recursive(n: number): number {
  // Base Case 1: If there is 1 step, there is only 1 way.
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  // Base Case 2: If there are 2 steps, there are 2 ways (1+1 or 2).
  if (n === 2) {
    return 2;
  }

  // Recursive Step: The total ways is the sum of ways to get to the previous two steps.
  // This leads to an exponential number of function calls.
  return climbStairs_recursive(n - 1) + climbStairs_recursive(n - 2);
}
```

"As we discussed, this solution is too slow. Now, I will implement the optimized Dynamic Programming solution."

**Solution 2: Dynamic Programming (O(n) Time, O(1) Space)**

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the number of ways to climb n stairs using an optimized
 * bottom-up dynamic programming approach with constant space.
 */
function climbStairs(n: number): number {
  // First, I'll handle the base cases. If n is 1 or 2, the number of ways is simply n.
  // This covers the edge cases and provides the starting point for our calculation.
  if (n <= 2) {
    return n;
  }

  // I'll initialize two variables to track the number of ways for the two preceding steps.
  // I'll start my loop from i=3, so these variables will represent the ways for
  // step 2 and step 1 respectively.
  let oneStepBefore = 2; // Represents ways(i-1), initialized for i=3, so it's ways(2).
  let twoStepsBefore = 1; // Represents ways(i-2), initialized for i=3, so it's ways(1).

  // I'll use a variable to store the ways for the current step `i`.
  let currentWays = 0;

  // Now, I'll loop from the 3rd step up to the target step `n`.
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    // The number of ways to reach the current step `i` is the sum of the ways
    // to reach the previous two steps, as per our recurrence relation.
    currentWays = oneStepBefore + twoStepsBefore;

    // For the next iteration, the step that was "one step before"
    // will now become "two steps before". We are sliding our window forward.
    twoStepsBefore = oneStepBefore;

    // And the `currentWays` we just calculated becomes the new "one step before".
    oneStepBefore = currentWays;
  }

  // After the loop finishes, `oneStepBefore` will hold the total number of ways for the nth step.
  // We can also return `currentWays` if n >= 3.
  return oneStepBefore;
}
```

#### **Step 4: Verification & Conclusion**

- **Goal:** Verify the optimal solution with a simple example and wrap up the discussion.

- **Simple Example (Dry Run with Optimal Solution):**
  - "Let's quickly test the optimal solution with `n = 4`.
  - `oneStepBefore` is 2, `twoStepsBefore` is 1.
  - `i = 3`: `currentWays` = 2 + 1 = 3. `oneStepBefore` becomes 3, `twoStepsBefore` becomes 2.
  - `i = 4`: `currentWays` = 3 + 2 = 5. `oneStepBefore` becomes 5, `twoStepsBefore` becomes 3.
  - The loop ends. We return 5. This matches the expected output."

- **Confirm the Final Complexity:**
  - "The final, optimal solution has a time complexity of **O(n)** due to the single loop, and a space complexity of **O(1)** as it only uses a constant number of variables."

- **Open for Discussion:**
  - "This bottom-up approach is efficient and solves the problem within the given constraints. Does this look good to you? Please let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions."
