### **English Language Resource for Week 1**

To replace the previous video, we will use another classic, in-depth talk that covers system design and technical trade-offs:

- **Video:** [10 Things I Regret About Node.js - Ryan Dahl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA)
- **Reasoning:** This video not only helps with clear pronunciation and listening practice but also provides deep insights into design decisions, mistakes, and lessons learnedâ€”valuable topics for both System Design and Behavioral interviews.

### **WEEK 1: Recursion, Sorting Algorithms & Linear Data Structures**

**Weekly Goals:**

- Master recursion and its application in algorithms.
- Achieve proficiency in sorting algorithms, from basic to advanced (Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
- Understand and be able to implement linear data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
- Build a solid foundation in System Design and apply its concepts to NodeJS.
- Connect theoretical knowledge with corresponding, themed LeetCode problems each day.
